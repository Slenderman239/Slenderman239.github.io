Hello everyone! My name is Jaime Y Camargo, im from Immokalee Florida for all my life.
After getting my high school diploma and getting a job as a CSR I soon wanted to become a Help Desk IT, which is why I enrolled in to Itech in CSIT (Computer System and Information Technology). 
My main/professional goal for comming here to be a Help Desk IT. I want to help people with tech and show them how certain software works and operatates.
